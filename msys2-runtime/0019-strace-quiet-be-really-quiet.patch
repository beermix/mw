Subject: [PATCH 19/N] strace --quiet: be *really* quiet

The biggest problem with strace spitting out `create_child: ...` despite
being asked to be real quiet is that its output can very well interfere
with scripts' operations.

For example, when running any of Git for Windows' shell scripts with
`GIT_STRACE_COMMANDS=/path/to/logfile` (which is sadly an often needed
debugging technique while trying to address the many MSYS2 issues Git for
Windows faces), any time the output of any command is redirected into a
variable, it will include that `create_child: ...` line, wreaking havoc
with Git's expectations.

So let's just really be quiet when we're asked to be quiet.
